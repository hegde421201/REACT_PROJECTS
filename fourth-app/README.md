## LEARNING

This react project contains:

1. creating customised css file (book.css)
2. importing the above css into the index.js file
3. adding classnames in the js file and referring to these objects in the css file
4. adding inline css on h4
5. Inline css takes more precedence over the css file styling.

We then go on to create a better booklist by creating BetterApp.js file. This includes the props concept. Props is nothing but properties.

First checkout this file [Customised CSS](https://github.com/hegde421201/REACT_PROJECTS/blob/main/fourth-app/src/book.css)

For Props check this out : [PROPS](https://github.com/hegde421201/REACT_PROJECTS/blob/main/fourth-app/src/BetterApp.js)
