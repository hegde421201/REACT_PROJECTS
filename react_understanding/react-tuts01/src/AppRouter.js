/**
  Multi page applications will have the entire page getting reloaded whereas single page applications 
  will have the main page loaded once and then the 
  sub-page sections are changing without a refresh and this is handled by javascript inside the browser.
  To make a single page app - the modern web development approach - we have to implement client-side routing. We will use react router v6 for this
  purpose.
